        <h2>Hovr Privacy Policy</h2>
        <hr>
      </div>
      <p class="text-muted">EFFECTIVE MARCH 16TH, 2020</p>
      <p class="text">
At Hovr, our goal is to provide a safe, efficient, and effective carpooling platform tailored for you and your employer. In order to do that, we collect, use, and share some of your personal information. This Privacy Policy is a guide to explain how Hovr does that, and your rights as a member of our community.
</br>
</br>
<h4>1. Policy Scope</h4>
This Privacy Policy covers Hovr’s treatment of your personally identifiable information and any other information you may provide us when using our website and/or our mobile application (referred to herein as the “Services”).
</br>
</br>
<h4>2. Information We Collect</h4>
We use your personal information for purposes such as verifying your employer and employee credentials, verifying your driving ability, your pick-up and drop off times and locations, matching you on the best possible routes and driver, and monitoring your decreased carbon footprint. Hovr focuses on using your personal information to provide and improve our Services, respond to your requests, service user accounts connected to our Services, provide you with products, services or information you may request, communicate with you, and inform you about new products and services that may be of interest and to improve our site.  We collect the following types of information:
</br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Information You Provide Us: Account registration details, driver related information, insurance related information, car details, workplace, ratings, feedback, comments, communications with Hovr</li>
  <li>Information We Collect from Users of our Services: Location information, usage information, device information, communications between users, ride history, cookies, analytics, use of third-party technologies</li>
  <li>Information We Collect from Third Parties: Information from employer, Hovr’s service providers, ad partners, insurance companies, court records, public databases and anything else that might allow Hovr to confirm and maintain accurate information.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h4>3. How We Use the Information We Collect</h4>
We may use the information that we collect for any of the following purposes:
</br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Improve Service functionality and efficiency</li>
  <li>Accurately match users with ideal driver and riders</li>
  <li>Provide, maintain and improve our services</li>
  <li>Provide assistance to users</li>
  <li>Personalize our services</li>
  <li>Measure and better understand Hovr’s performance</li>
  <li>Communicate with users</li>
  <li>Protect users, the community, Hovr and other legal reasons such as complying with applicable laws, assisting with law enforcement agencies if legally mandated, to find instances of abuse or misuse of Hovr’s services or illegal activity, maintain security and safety when using our Services</li>
</ul>
</br>
In the event that we determine we need to use your personal information for a reason not included in this Privacy Policy, we will ask for your consent first.
</br>
</br>
<h4>4. Sharing Information</h4>
Hovr does not sell your personal information. To better provide Services, Hovr may share your personal information with other Users of the Services, your employer, third parties (like social networks), and Hovr’s service providers.
</br>
</br>
We may share your information with third parties in other cases such as:
</br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>If a government body requests information and we deemed it to be necessary to disclose such information in order to comply with applicable laws and legal processes;</li>
  <li>To cooperate with law enforcement or other government authorities as it relates to any investigations or other inquiries to the extent, we deem it necessary to protect either our users, the public, or Hovr.</li>

  <li>Enforcing our Terms of Service.</li>
  <li>Responding to any legal process including court orders and search warrants.</li>
  <li>To detect or protect against fraud, security, technical or legal issues associated with the use of our Services.</li>
  <li>At any time that you consent to such sharing.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h4>5. Controlling Your Information</h4>
You have control over the information that you share with Hovr subject to certain limitations.
</br>
</br>
Hovr’s Services have been built in a way to minimize the amount of information that is stored within them. Nonetheless, if you want to review, update, change or delete the information that you have shared with Hovr, including deletion of your account, you may send a request to do so to <a href="mailto:support@hovrcarpool.com">support@hovrcarpool.com</a>. 
</br>
</br>
Even in the event that Hovr deletes your information, Hovr still may retain your ride history, without your personal information attached to the record of such ride(s). Hovr may also retain certain information for legitimate business purposes such as maintenance of security of the Services or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, depending on the circumstances of such deletion. You understand and agree that Hovr may have responsibility to law enforcement or other governmental entities or to its stakeholders, to maintain information if there is the possibility of any unsafe or illegal behavior to ensure the Services are not exploited in the future.
</br>
</br>
<h4>6. Age Restrictions</h4>
Hovr does not knowingly collect or solicit the personal information of anyone under the age of 13. Hovr is not intended for children and in the event that Hovr determines that a person under 13 has provided personal information, we will delete that information immediately.
</br>
</br>
<h4>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as necessary based on changes to Hovr or to applicable laws. In the event that we do update this Privacy Policy, such changes will be made online. You will be notified of any material changes through the mobile app or e-mail. Your use of the Services means that you are agreeing to the most recently updated Privacy Policy.

</br>
</br>
No assignment: These Terms and all rights and obligations ascribed to you hereunder, and/or your accounts associated with the Services, are personal to you and may not be transferred or assigned by you at any time, in any way, without the consent of Hovr. Hovr may assign its rights under these Terms at any time without your consent.
</br>
</br>
Choice of Law and Arbitration: These Terms, except to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Virginia without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. Any dispute arising from these Terms shall be subject to and settled within [PREFERRED COUNTY OF VIRGINIA], Virginia, in accordance with the jurisdiction’s arbitration rules in effect at that time, by one commercial arbitrator that has experience resolving disputes of the nature that is at hand. No class arbitrations shall be permitted. Notwithstanding the provisions relating to arbitration herein, the parties to these Terms hereby agree that each party has the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, at any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties hereto consent to the [PREFERRED COUNTY OF VIRGINIA], Virginia and the Eastern District Court of Virginia as having the exclusive jurisdiction over any court matters relating to these Terms. No class actions shall be permitted. BOTH PARTIES AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS BOTH YOU AND HOVR WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
</br>
</br>
Entire Agreement, Severability, Waiver: These Terms contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, which the parties acknowledge, if applicable, have been merged into these Terms. In case any provision in these Terms shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability. The failure of Hovr to exercise in any way, any rights afforded to Hovr pursuant to these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such rights or any other rights hereunder.
